Project: Bubble Sort

* Initialize a variable containing an array list
* Create method that repeatedly steps through the elements inside an array
* Compare the current element with the one after it. 
  * If the element is larger
     * Swap the current element, and continue the step using the larger element.
     * The current element must be swapped with the larger element and be reflected on the list
  * else
      Continue comparing until it reaches the end of the list until no swap occurs.
* If no swap occurs that means the list is fully sorted
